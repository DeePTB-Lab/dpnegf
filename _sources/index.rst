DPNEGF Documentation
=================================================

**DPNEGF** is a Python package that integrates the Deep Learning Tight-Binding (**DeePTB**) approach with the Non-Equilibrium Green's Function (**NEGF**) method, 
establishing an efficient quantum transport simulation framework **DeePTB-NEGF** with first-principles accuracy. 

--------------
Key Features:
--------------

By using DeePTB-SK or DeePTB-E3—both available within the DeePTB package—DeePTB-NEGF can compute quantum transport 
properties in open-boundary systems with either environment-corrected Slater-Koster(SK) TB Hamiltonian 
or linear combination of atomic orbitals (LCAO) Kohn-Sham Hamiltonian.
