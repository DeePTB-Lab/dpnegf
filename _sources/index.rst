DPNEGF Documentation
=================================================

**DPNEGF** is a Python package that integrates the Deep Learning Tight-Binding (**DeePTB**) approach with the Non-Equilibrium Greenâ€™s Function (**NEGF**) method, establishing an efficient quantum transport simulation framework **DeePTB-NEGF** with first-principles accuracy. 

--------------
Key Features:
--------------

DeePTB contains two main components: 

1. **DeePTB-SK**: deep learning based local environment dependent Slater-Koster TB.

   - Customizable Slater-Koster parameterization with neural network corrections.
   - Flexible basis and exchange-correlation functional choices.
   - Handle systems with strong spin-orbit coupling (SOC) effects.

2. **DeePTB-E3**: E3-equivariant neural networks for representing quantum operators.

   - Construct DFT Hamiltonians/density and overlap matrices under full LCAO basis.
   - Utilize (**S**\ trictly) **L**\ ocalized **E**\ quivariant **M**\ essage-passing (**(S)LEM**) model for high data-efficiency and accuracy.
   - Employs SO(2) convolution for efficient handling of higher-order orbitals in LCAO basis.
